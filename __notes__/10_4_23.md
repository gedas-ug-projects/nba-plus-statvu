# Next Steps

We want to train an automatic shot-outcome predictor. To do this we need lots of clips of people shooting. We have lots of logs with timestamps of when shots occured. We don't know what the timestamps corrospond to exactly just yet *(the start of the shot, the end?)* So we need to look through the logs and create an automatic process for jumping to point in a video where a shot supposedly occured.
