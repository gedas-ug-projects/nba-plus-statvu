**Problem**: Our shot extraction pipeline appears to work as intended. Given a video and its match game log, any event that is labeled as a 2 or 3-point shot attempt is extracted from the video. Unfortunately, it appears a large number of logs contain extremely noisy data. While shots are almost always accounted for, the actual start and ending times of shots can be off as much as 10-15s +. So while our pipeline works well when given good logs, in many cases our extraction method is faulty.

**Solution**: I propose we train a binary video classification model to label frames as either shooting or non-shooting. This solution should yeild both better retrieval accuracy and precision at a shot-retrieval task than our current method.
