## Where do we go from here?

We have two problems to solve and three models to train.
1. Need to increase text-recognition reliability to 95%+
2. Need better (localized) ROIs

**Models to Train**
1. YOLO-8 Localized ROI Detector
    - Model: YOLO-8 Nano
    - Object Classes: [time_remaining, quarter]
    - Benefits: if we can train a reliable OD -- can handle edge cases where roi's non-static???
    - Annotations: ~100 unqiue gfx, ~50k annotations/class -> 100k total or ~1k/video
    - Preprocessing: None
    - DB Size: ~50k images so ~5GB is target (i.e. 1/5 of COCO)
    - Problems: will quarter ROI's ever move? If so is there a better solution than looking for ROI for each frame.
        - Algo
            - If no ROI: detect
            - If detect > .9: use
            - If ROI can be classified with high conf: keep using
            - If conf drops for extended period (i.e. moved) -> find new ROI and backtrack to where conf droped 
2. Image Classifier for Quarters
    - Given image of quarter ROI clasify into one of four labels [1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th]
    - No idea what training dataset size will be. Should produce reliable results
    - Want to train on preprocessed ROI's
3. Find-Tuned Text-Recognition for Time-Remaining Values
    - Want to finetune either Tesseract or EasyOCR
    - Again no idea as to size/scope of training set required
    - Want to train on preprocessed ROI's
