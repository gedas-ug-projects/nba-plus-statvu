The log problem.

- The game logs appear to be inconsistent and imprecise. The most common issue is that the logs provide enormous time windows for a shot. A 3 point shot, which may take 2-3 seconds, will often be described using a 30 seconds window or larger. At this point it is inevitable that we will need some video classification techniques to automatically trim down video clips to just the shot events.
- I honestly believe we will be better off attempting to do shot-detection from video classification alone. We can still use our temporal grounding pipeline to obtain made/missed labels, but even those might be inconsistent.

**Shot Extraction Using Temporal Action Localization**
1. Train a binary video-classifer to sort videos into release/non-release buckets.
2. Define a context window of ~2 seconds, slide this context window over a video and save each window as a video.
3. Perform inference on the window, save each confidence score as the likelyhood the midpoint frame belongs to a shooting clip
    - Final scores for a video might look like [.., 0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.0, 0.8, 0.5, 0.3, ...]
    - Smooth these values (i.e. via gaussian noise) and quantize them: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
    - Continuous blocks of 1s will be considered shot-clip intervals
    - *This method may be overly expensive/otherwise inefficent*
