# Inital Clock-ROI Detection Results

- YOLO-8 Models
    1. NANO PT | ~200 test, 200 val images. 50 epochs. Surprisingly good results.
    2. NANO PT | ~1500 test. 300 epochs. Looks overfit. Does not generalize as well and background are completely mislabled.

- Retraining and Data Prep
    - Scale up dataset to from 10 -> 20 clock examples
    - Write script to remove all background annotations
    - Increase batch size from 16 -> 32 -> 64*
