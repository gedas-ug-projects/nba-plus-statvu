- Problem: Google Colab can not process folders with too many children.
- Solution: Restructure dataset and upload
    - Train Folder (10K): 
        - 10 videos (1K)
        - subdirs(100)
- Problem: dataset is massive
- Solution: figure out exactly how many annotations you need to effectively identify an object of one class
    - ~10,000 images / class
    - ~10% images should be background only

Tasks
1. Put images from the same video into identical folders

example_string = "clock_roi_as_1_frame_000000"
title_only = example_string[:-13]
