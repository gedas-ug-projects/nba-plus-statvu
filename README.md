# SportVU Plus Videos: An NBA Dataset With Game Footage

    - This project is an extension of the NBA Player Movement dataset curated with data from the 2015-2016 NBA regular season. We have provided matching game footage for each orginal data file. Additionally, we have added spatial and temporal information to each orginial data file to allow researchers to use both player position data and video in concert.
