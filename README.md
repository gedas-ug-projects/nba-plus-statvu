# **Automated Shot-Quality Analysis with Video Classification Models**
***

**Overview**: Can a model learn the features that define good basketball players from video alone? We seek to answer this question by training a model to predict the outcome of basketball shot clips from pre-release context alone.

**Project Goals**:
- [x] Build a temporal grounding pipeline for basketball broadcast footage.
- [ ] Gather and annotate mass amounts of player-shooting clips from a dataset.
- [ ] Train a model to predict the outcomes of annotated shot clips by providing a confidence score in range [0-1].
