# Automated Shot-Clip Extraction and Labeling


## Roadmap
- [ ] Extract ~50-100k shot clip examples (pre-shot context + labels)
- [ ] Train a Shot Make/Miss Classifier w/Post-Release Context as an Experiment
- [ ] Train a POC Video Classifier to Predict Outcomes of Labeled Videos
- [ ] Scale Up and Train a Hard-Core Predictive Model
